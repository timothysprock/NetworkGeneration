# NetworkGeneration

This work is being continued under the System-Analysis Integration Project at NIST:

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop abstractions and methodologies to integrate systems models with analysis models and tools, such as discrete event simulation.

This analysis generation methodology was developed while I was a PhD student in the school of industrial and system engineering at Georgia Tech (https://factory.isye.gatech.edu/).

Initial implementations were publish at the 2014 Winter Simulation Conference:
Sprock, Timothy, and Leon F. McGinnis. 2014. “Simulation Model Generation of Discrete Event Logistics Systems (DELS) Using Software Patterns.” In Proceedings of the 2014 Winter Simulation Conference. Savannah, GA.

The associated abstractions are documented in a companion repository:
